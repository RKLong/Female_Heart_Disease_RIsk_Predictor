# Female_Heart_Disease_Risk_Predictor
This project deals with Heart Disease Risk data analysis based on the Framingham study that comprises of 4238 records containing heart related health parameters and demographics of a set of patients.  With this current dataset which is related to Heart Disease, our objective is to identify whether a patient is at risk for heart disease or not, based on features such as preexisting conditions, medication, age group and other parameters.

## Role in the Project
This was a capstone project for a Data Analystics and Visualization Bootcamp by UC Berkeley-Extension. It was a group project, and there were four members in our group. Together with another cohort, we were primarily responsible for the creation of the database, ETL of the data and the creation of the dashboard using Tableau.
