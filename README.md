# Female_Heart_Disease_RIsk_Predictor
This project deals with Heart Disease Risk data analysis based on the Framingham study that comprises of 4238 records containing heart related health parameters and demographics of a set of patients.  With this current dataset which is related to Heart Disease, our objective is to identify whether a patient is at risk for heart disease or not, based on features such as preexisting conditions, medication, age group and other parameters.

## Role in the Project
Together with a fellow cohort, we were primarily responsible for the creation of the database, ETL of the data and the creation of the dashboard using Tableau.
